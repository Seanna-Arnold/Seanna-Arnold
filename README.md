### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

These projects give you a taste of my knack for diving into development from Django to React and a dash of SQL in between, I've had a blast exploring fullstack development as well as building some interactive projects to uncover some pretty neat stuff!

Please be sure to keep an eye on my github as I get further into my program!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my fullstack Javascript skills!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on React and exploring other frontend frameworks.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about why I want to be a Frontend/UI Developer

- âš¡ Fun fact: I've been caught in a Saharan sandstorm, grew up from across a field of zebras AND I'm from a country with the highest amount of rugby world cup winsðŸ‡¿ðŸ‡¦!
